## Required Knowledge

There are two main channels for transferring funds between banking services. One is **InstaPay**, which processes digital money in real-time, meaning balances update right away after a successful transaction. The second one is **PESONet**, which processes money in cut-off time. This means that the money will be transferred at cut-off time **IF** the transaction is done before the cut-off time. Otherwise, it will be processed in the next working day *(excludes weekends and holidays)*. Also mind that these channels have their respective transaction limits, be it transactional or time-based *(daily, monthly, weekly)*, or both *(e.g., Maya and BPI)*. The limit of each channel varies on the bank using their service.

## Table of Banking Services and Their Fee-Free Transactions

The **Service** column contains the banking service the fund will be coming from in a transaction. **Recipient Service** is the banking service that is on the receiving end of the transaction. **Description** contains how to make a fee-free transaction or none at all.
