## Free Interest Rate Boost in Maya

Maya offers a base 3.50% p.a interest rate for users who open a savings account. In addition, Maya has a feature wherein users can boost their interest rate every month by spending specific amounts of money in said account. By doing these tasks, users can gain up to 8.50% increase in their account's interest rate.

Now, the title of this section might seem contradictory to the given tasks that boosts the account's interest rate which is all about spending specific amounts of money. And in reality, you are going to need to spend to get these boosts. However, a hack can be done in order to get the boosts while not spending a single peso.

Grab offers a wallet feature called "**GrabPay**" wherein users can deposit to and use the balance to pay for whatever they buy from the app. When depositing or cashing in money from GrabPay, the "sender" account counts this as a transaction. Back to Maya, this technically is considered as "spending", which passes the criteria of the tasks that increase the account's interest rate. **GrabPay** has other features other than depositing to it. It also allows users to send and receive money from other Grab wallets AND transfer to other banks. Furthermore, this transfer feature does not cost any transaction fees. With tthis, we can send the money we just deposited back to our account, all while not really spending.

> [!NOTE]
>
> It is advised to wait for a couple of hours after the cash-in process is done before sending the money back to your Maya account.

### Required Knowledge

There are two main channels for transferring funds between banking services. One is **InstaPay**, which processes digital money in real-time, meaning balances update right away after a successful transaction. The second one is **PESONet**, which processes money in cut-off time. This means that the money will be transferred at cut-off time **IF** the transaction is done before the cut-off time. Otherwise, it will be processed in the next working day *(excludes weekends and holidays)*. Also mind that these channels have their respective transaction limits, be it transactional or time-based *(daily, monthly, weekly)*, or both *(e.g., Maya and BPI)*. The limit of each channel varies on the bank using their service.
